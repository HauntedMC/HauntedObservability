# Release process

Observability publishes `haunted-observability-bom` for its own modules. Its optional DataProvider, DataRegistry, and FeatureFramework adapters compile against versions selected here.

From clean, current `main`, run `./tools/release/update-version patch --pr` (or `minor`/`major` for an intentional API change). The command checks the project-specific version metadata, commits the changes, and opens a reviewed PR. Without `--pr`, it only prepares a local diff; `--dry-run` changes nothing. Merge after CI passes. Do not create or push a release tag manually.

A version change on `main` starts `.github/workflows/release.yml`. The workflow runs the `release` release profiles, deploys the verified Maven reactor with `deployAtEnd`, resolves the published coordinates from an empty Maven repository, and only then creates tag `vX.Y.Z` and a GitHub Release. The release dispatches HauntedPlatform's dependency reconciler, which proposes reviewed downstream PRs only after the package is available.

If publication fails before the tag, inspect whether any immutable coordinates were uploaded, fix the problem, then retry with `workflow_dispatch`. Do not overwrite a published version or move a tag. If dispatch fails after the tag, manually run HauntedPlatform's **Reconcile internal dependency PRs** workflow with this repository name and the published version. The [organization release guide](https://github.com/HauntedMC/HauntedPlatform/blob/main/docs/releasing.md) describes the graph and GitHub App setup.
